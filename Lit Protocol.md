> Lit is a blockchain-agnostic middleware network that can be used to read and write data between blockchains, state machines, and off-chain platforms with conditional decryption and programmatic signing.
> Lit (Lockable Interactive Token) Protocol is a decentralized access control network that provides infrastructure for granting permissions between blockchain users and the world they interact with. In order to understand Lit, one must understand Access control lists (ACL). In modern computer security, an access-control list (ACL) is a mechanism used to define who has access to your data and objects, as well as what level of access they have. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects and actions that users can take on specific data and objects within it. Lit acts a decentralized ACL which leverages on-chain data from user's wallets to grant access to certain content or software. The easiest way to think of Lit is middleware that enables gated experiences based on what's in a given users wallet.
